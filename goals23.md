# Accomplishments from 2022:

- Produced new documentation for DBIC standard operating procedures for peripheral equipment, including: BIOPAC, Eye-Tracker Screen, Optoacoustics Microphone, Panasonic projector, Lumina Box, Sensimetrics earbuds, Current Designs 932 interface. 

- Made progress toward updating DBIC data access and storage. Specifically: expanded local storage capacity on DICOM server and backup servers; initiated and facilitated steps to expand the DBIC storage capacity on Discovery and to make DBIC fMRI data accessible from Discovery; Worked with RC computing to create a remote NFS mount from Discovery nodes to access MRI-Inbox data and to install a high bandwidth connection from Moore Hall servers to RC Discovery servers.

- Maintained critical computing infrastructure and data, and managed user accounts for DBIC computers and DBIC Discovery users.

- Initiated the purchase and installation of two new Uninterruptible Power Supply (APC) units for DBIC servers.

- Presented a poster at VSS conference and worked on further development of the video capture system Reprostim.

- Worked to make publicly available dataset, eg HCP, Narratives, NSD datasets. Added documentation about datasets to the DBIC webpage.

# Specific Goals for 2023:

## Systems Administration

- Continue to maintain, update, and enhance the DBIC Data Servers, fMRI
  peripheral equipment, and computing infrastructure.

- Enhance, update, and expand DBIC Documentation, user manuals, and training
  protocols.

- Work with RC Administrators to provide support for DBIC users of the Discovery Cluster.

## Data Administration and Architecture

- Continue to work with RC Adminisrators to enhance accessibility to procured DBIC datasets on the Discovery Cluster.

- Automate and enhance the conversion of raw fMRI data into BIDS format
  accessible on Discovery.

## Data Analysis

- Work with Tor to develop data analysis for HCP data.

- Develop and communicate workflows for data analysis pipelines. 

# Training and professional development activities for 2023

- Pursue training and certification for Data Science related skills to
  complement DBIC duties.

- Work to improve communication of daily and on going activities with team and
  DBIC community.
